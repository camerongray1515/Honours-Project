\title{Prophasis - An IT Infrastructure Monitoring Solution - Interim Report}
\author{Cameron Gray}
\abstract{Prophasis is an IT infrastructure monitoring system that is designed
to suit small to medium size businesses where a system needs to be intuitive to
manage. Management of the entire system can therefore be handled from a single,
responsive web interface. It is also suitable as a one-stop tool with support
for both time series monitoring in addition to real time alerting.
Traditionally two different tools would be needed to gain this level of
monitoring.}

\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}
\paragraph*{}
	% TODO: Reword this?
	In recent years, almost all businesses have been expanding their IT 
	infrastructure to handle the modern demand for IT systems.  As these systems
	grow and become increasingly important for business operation it is crucial
	that they are sufficiently monitored to prevent faults and periods of downtime
	going unnoticed.  There is already a large market of tools for monitoring
	IT systems however they are designed for use on massive scale networks managed
	by teams of specialised systems administrators.  They are therefore
	complicated to set up and manage and multiple tools are often required to gain
	a suitable level of monitoring.
	
\paragraph*{}
	For example, tools generally either fall into
	the category of real time alerting (i.e. telling someone when something
	breaks) and time series monitoring (i.e. capturing data about the performance
	of systems and presenting graphs and statistics based on it), there is a large
	gap in the market for tools that provide both of these in one package. This
	reduces the time required to manage the system as it eliminates the need to
	set up and configure two completely separate tools.

\paragraph*{}	
	These tools are also generally managed and configured through various
	configuration files split across different machines on the network. This means
	that in order to efficiently use these tools a configuration management system
	such as	Puppet must be used. In a small business with limited IT resources, a
	completely self contained system is often preferable.

\section{Improvements}
% TODO: Find a better place for this?
\paragraph*{}
	Prophasis is designed for use in a small to medium business with limited IT
	resources.  They may have a small IT team with limited resources or may not
	even have a dedicated IT team at all, instead relying on one or two employees
	in other roles who manage the business's IT systems on the side of their
	regular jobs. Therefore the system needs to be quick to deploy and manage with
	a shallow learning curve. In order to use the system efficiently there should
	be no requirement for additional tooling to be deployed across the company.
	
\subsection{Configuration Management}
\paragraph*{}
	It should be possible to manage the configuration of the system from a single
	location.  Prophasis therefore provides a responsive web interface where every
	aspect of the system's operation can be configured, Prophasis then handles
	distributing this configuration to all other machines in the system in the
	background. Custom code for plugins is handled in the same way; it is uploaded
	to the single management machine and is then automatically distributed to the
	appropriate remote machines when it is required.
	
\subsection{Time Series Monitoring \& Real Time Alerting}
\paragraph*{}
	Prophasis provides both the ability to alert administrators in real time when
	a fault is discovered with the system alongside functionality to collect
	performance metrics over time and use this data to generate statistics about
	how the system has been performing.  This time series data can be used to both
	investigate the cause of a failure in post-mortem investigations in addition
	to being able to be used to predict future failures by looking at trends in
	the collected data.
	
\subsection{Expandability}
\paragraph*{}
	It is important that a monitoring tool can be expanded to support the
	monitoring of custom hardware and software.  An example of this would be
	hardware RAID cards.  Getting the drive health from these types of devices
	can range from probing for SMART data all the way to communicating with the
	card over a serial port.  It is therefore crucial that Prophasis can be
	easily expanded to support custom functionality such as this. Therefore 
	Prophasis supports a system of custom "plugins" which can be written and
	uploaded to the monitoring server where they can then be configured to monitor
	machines. These plugins are designed to be self contained and to follow a well
	defined and documented structure.  This provides scope for a plugin
	"marketplace" much like there already exists for plugins for software such as
	Wordpress and Drupal allowing plugins to be easily shared and installed for
	monitoring various pieces of hardware and software, therefore eliminating the
	need for every user to implement custom monitoring code for the systems they
	are using.
