Plugin
======
Python module that follows a defined interface, when called it checks a
single aspect of the system and returns data from it in the form of both
a value (which is used to eventually establish the alert level or for
graphing, often numeric) and a message which provides more information
such as "disk failure in bay 2".

Agent
=====
Runs on remote host, listens for HTTP(S) requests and executes plugins.
Returns the data retrieved from the plugin as JSON.
Agent is also responsible for updating and installing plugins on the
system.

Core
====
The core runs on the montoring server and is responsible for sending
requests for data to the agents as and when required.  It is also
responsible for inserting the retrieved data into the database.

Web
===
This is a web interface to both view the data collected as well as for
configuring the system.  All configuration is managed through the web
interface to keep it in one place.

Alerter
=======
The alerter sits on top of the data and constantly checks it against
defined alert levels to ensure that everything is working correctly.
If it finds anything that is outwith these levels it will send out
appropriate notifications.
